# Performance

The SDK is designed for low overhead. This page describes the key design choices and
the patterns that keep your application fast.

## Transport

The SDK ships three client variants, with two different application-protocol
stacks underneath:

- `Index` and `AsyncIndex` (REST): [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/) over
  HTTP/1.1 with connection keepalive.
- `GrpcIndex`: a native (Rust-backed) gRPC channel over HTTP/2 with binary
  protobuf framing.

This protocol gap is part of why gRPC has a measurable throughput edge on
bulk upsert workloads — see [When to Use gRPC](#when-to-use-grpc). For the
REST clients, parallel batched upsert (below) is what you reach for to drive
concurrency.

## Connection Pooling

Both `Pinecone` and `Index` maintain a persistent `httpx.Client` (or `httpx.AsyncClient`
for the async variants). Creating a new client for every request wastes time on TLS
handshakes and connection setup.

**Reuse the same `Index` instance** across calls rather than constructing a new one each
time:

```python
# Good — one client, many calls
from pinecone import Pinecone

pc = Pinecone()
desc = pc.indexes.describe("product-search")
index = pc.index(host=desc.host)

for batch in batches:
    index.upsert(vectors=batch)

# Bad — a new HTTP client for every upsert
for batch in batches:
    index = pc.index(host=desc.host)  # new client every time
    index.upsert(vectors=batch)
```

Use the context manager protocol to ensure connections are released when you are done:

```python
with pc.index(host=desc.host) as index:
    index.upsert(vectors=large_batch)
```

## Fast Serialization with msgspec and orjson

Response models are `msgspec.Struct` instances. `msgspec` uses zero-copy deserialization
and avoids Python object allocation overhead that Pydantic-based models incur. Request
bodies are serialized with `orjson`, which is typically 5–10× faster than the standard
library `json` module.

These libraries are always active — no configuration is needed.

## Cold Import Cost

The SDK uses lazy imports to keep its cold-start time under 10 ms. Top-level SDK
symbols (`Pinecone`, `AsyncPinecone`, etc.) are available as soon as you import
`pinecone`, but heavy modules — the gRPC channel, pandas (for
`upsert_from_dataframe`), tqdm (for progress bars) — are only loaded when you
actually use them.

If your application is latency-sensitive at startup, avoid importing `pinecone` in
module-level code that runs before it is needed:

```python
# Fine — deferred to first use
def get_index() -> Index:
    from pinecone import Pinecone
    pc = Pinecone()
    return pc.index(host="...")
```

## Batching Large Upserts

For datasets larger than a single request payload, pass `batch_size` to
`Index.upsert()`. The SDK splits the input into batches and sends them in parallel —
sync via a cached `ThreadPoolExecutor`, async via an `asyncio.Semaphore`. HTTP-level
retries happen automatically per batch.

```python
response = index.upsert(
    vectors=large_list,    # any length
    batch_size=100,        # vectors per request
    max_concurrency=4,     # parallel in-flight requests (default 4, range 1–64)
)
print(response.upserted_count)         # successful items
print(response.failed_item_count)      # 0 if everything succeeded
```

The same kwargs are accepted on `AsyncIndex.upsert()`, `Index.upsert_from_dataframe()`,
and `Index.upsert_records()`.

When `batch_size` is set, `upsert()` returns an `UpsertResponse` with partial-failure
information instead of raising on the first failed batch — see
[Handling partial failures](../how-to/vectors/upsert-and-query.md#handling-partial-failures).

### How much faster is parallel batching?

Measured on 10k vectors / 1536-d / batch=100 against an aws-us-east-1 serverless
index, sync REST `Index`:

| Client | Path | Wall time | Speedup |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| v8 | sequential loop (baseline) | 112 s | 1.0× |
| v9 | `max_concurrency=4` (default) | 9.6 s | **11.7×** |
| v9 | `max_concurrency=8` | 5.7 s | 19.7× |
| v9 | `max_concurrency=16` | 5.0 s | 22.3× |
| v9 | `max_concurrency=32` | 4.4 s | 25.5× |

The v8 row is the published `pinecone==8.x` client running its sequential
`batch_size=` loop; the v9 rows are this client using native parallel batched
upsert. Async REST follows the same shape with somewhat smaller speedups,
since v8 async sequential was already faster than v8 sync sequential. gRPC is
faster than REST at high concurrency — see
[When to Use gRPC](#when-to-use-grpc). Numbers come from a controlled
benchmark; see [Methodology](#methodology).

### Tuning `max_concurrency`

The default of `4` is calibrated to capture ~70% of the achievable speedup with
modest pressure on the cluster — safe to use without tuning. Push higher only when
you have a reason and can measure the result on your workload:

| `max_concurrency` | When to use it |
|---:|---|
| `1` | Strict per-second quota, or you want sequential semantics for ordering |
| `4` *(default)* | General use; ~70% of the win, no tuning required |
| `8` | Large bulk loads on a well-provisioned index — typically the sweet spot |
| `16–32` | Diminishing returns; the cluster (not the SDK) is usually the bottleneck above ~16 |
| `>32` | Rarely worth it for a single client; consider sharding the work across multiple clients instead |

Throughput saturates around `c≈16` for most workloads because cluster-side
ingress capacity becomes the bottleneck, not the SDK. If you do need to push past
that ceiling, run multiple `Index` instances from separate processes rather than
raising `max_concurrency` further on one client.

For multi-million-vector loads from cloud storage, prefer `index.start_import()`
over batched upsert — it avoids per-batch HTTP overhead entirely.

## Async Concurrency

Pick the async client (`AsyncPinecone` / `AsyncIndex`) when your code is already
inside an `async def` — most often because you're conforming to the interface of
an async web framework like **FastAPI**, **Starlette**, or **Litestar**, where
request handlers are coroutines. In that setting, calling a blocking sync method
either stalls the event loop (degrading throughput for every concurrent request)
or forces you to offload to a thread; the async client lets you `await` Pinecone
calls inline without either workaround.

The async client is also natural when you want concurrent reads and writes that
should overlap — multiple queries in flight, or a query running while an upsert
finishes — though sync code can achieve the same with threads.

For **pure bulk upsert**, prefer native batched upsert over a hand-rolled
`asyncio.gather` — same parallelism, less code, automatic retries, and partial-failure
reporting:

```python
# Preferred
async with pc.index(host=desc.host) as index:
    response = await index.upsert(
        vectors=large_list,
        batch_size=100,
        max_concurrency=8,
    )
```

For **mixed workloads** — concurrent upserts and queries, or query fan-out across
many namespaces — `asyncio.gather` over `AsyncIndex` calls is still the natural
pattern:

```python
async with pc.index(host=desc.host) as index:
    results = await asyncio.gather(
        index.upsert(vectors=writes_batch, batch_size=100),
        index.query(vector=q1, top_k=10),
        index.query(vector=q2, top_k=10),
    )
```

Sync vs async at high concurrency: with native batched upsert at `max_concurrency=32`,
sync (~4.4 s) edges out async (~5.0 s) on the 10k-vector benchmark — the cached
`ThreadPoolExecutor` is competitive with `asyncio.Semaphore` once cluster-side
ingress dominates. Pick the client that matches your application style; throughput
is similar at the saturation point.

## When to Use gRPC

`pinecone.grpc.GrpcIndex` accepts the same `batch_size=` and `max_concurrency=`
kwargs as the REST `Index`, so the call site looks identical. The wire-level
differences are HTTP/2 framing (vs HTTP/1.1 + keepalive on REST) and binary
protobuf encoding (vs JSON). The gRPC channel ships with the package — no
separate install step.

The numbers, on the same 10k-vector / 1536-d / batch=100 benchmark
([Methodology](#methodology)) — wall time, p50:

| Client | `max_concurrency` | REST sync | REST async | gRPC |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| v8 | sequential | 112 s | 67 s | 34 s |
| v9 | 1 | 31.5 s | 32.7 s | 35.0 s |
| v9 | 4 (default) | 9.6 s | 10.2 s | 10.0 s |
| v9 | 8 | 5.7 s | 5.9 s | 5.7 s |
| v9 | 16 | 5.0 s | 6.6 s | 4.0 s |
| v9 | 32 | 4.4 s | 5.0 s | 2.7 s |

A few things stand out:

- **Even sequential, v8 gRPC was ~3× faster than v8 REST sync** (34 s vs 112 s).
  HTTP/2 multiplexing and protobuf encoding buy a lot before any parallelism
  enters the picture — and that gap is structural to the protocols, not
  something parallel batching alone closes.
- **At default settings, the three transports are essentially tied** (~10 s).
  For typical workloads, the choice is about API style, not throughput.
- **gRPC pulls ahead as concurrency rises** — at `max_concurrency=32`, gRPC
  finishes the same work 1.5–1.9× faster than REST.
- **`max_concurrency=1` doesn't help gRPC** — v8 gRPC was already pipelining
  requests over its HTTP/2 channel, so the new code path's win at gRPC comes
  from explicit fan-out at higher concurrency, not from the new partial-success
  machinery.

Pick gRPC when:

- You're doing **sustained bulk upserts at `max_concurrency` ≥ 16** — gRPC
  finishes the same work 1.5–1.9× faster than REST at that concurrency.
- You want the **lowest absolute write latency floor** on a single client
  (~2.7 s for 10k vectors at `c=32` on the reference workload).

Stay on REST when:

- You're at default settings or low concurrency — there is no measurable
  throughput benefit at `max_concurrency` ≤ 8.
- You need async — `GrpcIndex` is sync-only; for async workloads use
  `AsyncIndex` over REST.

```python
from pinecone import Pinecone

pc = Pinecone()
with pc.index(name="product-search", grpc=True) as index:
    response = index.upsert(
        vectors=large_list,
        batch_size=100,
        max_concurrency=16,
    )
```

## Summary

| Technique | Where it helps |
|-----------|---------------|
| HTTP keepalive (REST) / HTTP/2 (gRPC) | Reused TCP connections, lower per-call setup cost |
| Reuse `Index` instance | Eliminate per-call TLS/connection overhead |
| msgspec structs | Response deserialization — faster than Pydantic |
| orjson | Request serialization — faster than stdlib `json` |
| Lazy imports | Reduce cold-start time |
| `Index.upsert(batch_size=…, max_concurrency=…)` | Bulk upsert — typical 10–25× over a sequential loop |
| `AsyncIndex` + `asyncio.gather()` | Mixed concurrent read/write workloads |
| `GrpcIndex` (sync only) | Sustained bulk upserts at `max_concurrency` ≥ 16 — ~1.5–1.9× over REST |
| `index.start_import()` | Multi-million-vector loads from cloud storage |

## Methodology

The numbers in this guide come from a controlled benchmark — 10,000 random
1536-dimensional vectors, `batch_size=100`, single client, fresh namespace per
run, against an aws-us-east-1 serverless index. The "v8 sequential" rows use
`pinecone==8.1.2` from PyPI (sequential `batch_size=` loop, fail-fast on first
batch error). The `max_concurrency=N` rows use this version of the SDK with
native parallel batched upsert. Each row is the p50 of 3 measured iterations
after 1 warmup.

Your numbers will vary with region, RTT, vector dimension, batch size, payload
metadata, and concurrent traffic from other clients. When in doubt, measure
on your own workload.
