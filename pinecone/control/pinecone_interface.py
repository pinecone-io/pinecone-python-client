        ### Configuration with environment variables

        If you instantiate the Pinecone client with no arguments, it will attempt to read the API key from the environment variable `PINECONE_API_KEY`.

        ```python
        from pinecone import Pinecone

        pc = Pinecone()
        ```

        ### Configuration with keyword arguments

        If you prefer being more explicit in your code, you can also pass the API  as a keyword argument.

        ```python
        import os
        from pinecone import Pinecone

        pc = Pinecone(api_key=os.environ.get("PINECONE_API_KEY"))
        ```

        ### Environment variables

        The Pinecone client supports the following environment variables:

        - `PINECONE_API_KEY`: The API key to use for authentication. If not passed via
        kwarg, the API key will be read from the environment variable `PINECONE_API_KEY`.

        - `PINECONE_DEBUG_CURL`: When troubleshooting it can be very useful to run curl
        commands against the control plane API to see exactly what data is being sent
        and received without all the abstractions and transformations applied by the Python
        SDK. If you set this environment variable to `true`, the Pinecone client will use
        request parameters to print out an equivalent curl command that you can run yourself
        or share with Pinecone support. **Be very careful with this option, as it will print out
        your API key** which forms part of a required authentication header. Default: `false`

        ### Proxy configuration

        If your network setup requires you to interact with Pinecone via a proxy, you will need
        to pass additional configuration using optional keyword parameters. These optional parameters
        are forwarded to `urllib3`, which is the underlying library currently used by the Pinecone client to
        make HTTP requests. You may find it helpful to refer to the
        [urllib3 documentation on working with proxies](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced-usage.html#http-and-https-proxies)
        while troubleshooting these settings.

        Here is a basic example:

        ```python
        from pinecone import Pinecone

        pc = Pinecone(
            api_key='YOUR_API_KEY',
            proxy_url='https://your-proxy.com'
        )

        pc.list_indexes()
        ```

        If your proxy requires authentication, you can pass those values in a header dictionary using the `proxy_headers` parameter.

        ```python
        from pinecone import Pinecone
        import urllib3 import make_headers

        pc = Pinecone(
            api_key='YOUR_API_KEY',
            proxy_url='https://your-proxy.com',
            proxy_headers=make_headers(proxy_basic_auth='username:password')
        )

        pc.list_indexes()
        ```

        ### Using proxies with self-signed certificates

        By default the Pinecone Python client will perform SSL certificate verification
        using the CA bundle maintained by Mozilla in the [certifi](https://pypi.org/project/certifi/) package.
        If your proxy server is using a self-signed certificate, you will need to pass the path to the certificate
        in PEM format using the `ssl_ca_certs` parameter.

        ```python
        from pinecone import Pinecone
        import urllib3 import make_headers

        pc = Pinecone(
            api_key='YOUR_API_KEY',
            proxy_url='https://your-proxy.com',
            proxy_headers=make_headers(proxy_basic_auth='username:password'),
            ssl_ca_certs='path/to/cert-bundle.pem'
        )

        pc.list_indexes()
        ```

        ### Disabling SSL verification

        If you would like to disable SSL verification, you can pass the `ssl_verify`
        parameter with a value of `False`. We do not recommend going to production with SSL verification disabled.

        ```python
        from pinecone import Pinecone
        import urllib3 import make_headers

        pc = Pinecone(
            api_key='YOUR_API_KEY',
            proxy_url='https://your-proxy.com',
            proxy_headers=make_headers(proxy_basic_auth='username:password'),
            ssl_ca_certs='path/to/cert-bundle.pem',
            ssl_verify=False
        )

        In production situations, you want to uspert or query your data as quickly
        as possible. If you know in advance the host url of your index, you can
        eliminate a round trip to the Pinecone control plane by specifying the

        ```

        To find your host url, you can use the Pinecone control plane to describe
        the index. The host url is returned in the response. Or, alternatively, the
        host is displayed in the Pinecone web console.

        ```python
        import os
        from pinecone import Pinecone

        pc = Pinecone(
            api_key=os.environ.get("PINECONE_API_KEY")
        )

        host = pc.describe_index('index-name').host
        ```

        ### Target an index by name (not recommended for production)

        For more casual usage, such as when you are playing and exploring with Pinecone
        in a notebook setting, you can also target an index by name. If you use this
        approach, the client may need to perform an extra call to the Pinecone control
        plane to get the host url on your behalf to get the index host.

        The client will cache the index host for future use whenever it is seen, so you
        will only incur the overhead of only one call. But this approach is not
        recommended for production usage.

        ```python
        import os
        from pinecone import Pinecone, ServerlessSpec

        api_key = os.environ.get("PINECONE_API_KEY")

        pc = Pinecone(api_key=api_key)
        pc.create_index(
            name='my_index',
            dimension=1536,
            metric='cosine',

        # Now you're ready to perform data operations
        index.query(vector=[...], top_k=10)
        ```

        Arguments:
            name: The name of the index to target. If you specify the name of the index, the client will
                fetch the host url from the Pinecone control plane.
            host: The host url of the index to target. If you specify the host url, the client will use
                the host url directly without making any additional calls to the control plane.
            pool_threads: The number of threads to use when making parallel requests by calling index methods with optional kwarg async_req=True, or using methods that make use of parallelism automatically such as query_namespaces(). Default: 1
            connection_pool_maxsize: The maximum number of connections to keep in the connection pool. Default: 5 * multiprocessing.cpu_count()
