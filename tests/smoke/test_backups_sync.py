"""Smoke test — sync backup lifecycle against ``Pinecone.backups``.

Gated by ``SMOKE_RUN_BACKUPS=1`` because backups require a configured
data-integration on the project. When the env var is unset, the
whole module is skipped.

Punchlist coverage (sync): Backups.create, list, describe, get, delete.
