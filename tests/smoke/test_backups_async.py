"""Smoke test — async backup lifecycle against ``AsyncPinecone.backups``.

Gated by ``SMOKE_RUN_BACKUPS=1`` because backups require a configured
data-integration on the project. When the env var is unset, the
whole module is skipped.

Punchlist coverage (async): AsyncBackups.create, list, describe, get, delete.
